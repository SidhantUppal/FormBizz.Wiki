Based on the types of clients we work with we undergo an annual Pentest.. The frequency of this testing is increased as and when there are major changes to the application. 

In addition to our own application Pentesting the ASPNETZERO framework is tested for vulnerabilities, results of which can be found [here](https://docs.aspnetzero.com/en/common/latest/Security-Report-Core).
