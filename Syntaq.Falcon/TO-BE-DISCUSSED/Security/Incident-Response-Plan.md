# Plan Triggering Events 
Each of the above mentioned disasters are recognised as the trigger to initiate the recovery plan. These are periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  

# Emergency Response Team 
It is the duty of the highest-ranking staff available at the time of the disaster occurring to form an Emergency Response Team and delineate their roles and responsibilities.  

 

# ERT Duties 
The Emergency Response Team completes a number of tasks, including: 
- Assessing the impact of the disaster and its impact on business-critical equipment/services/data 
- Contacting internal and external stakeholders/authorities where applicable 
- Provisioning the required material/equipment for the recovery phase 
- Establishing the disaster recovery team 

# Disaster Recovery Team 
Following the assessment and provisioning phases, the ERT morphs into the Disaster Recovery team to carry out the following tasks: 
- Establish facilities for an emergency-level service to be provided within 2.0 business hours of the disaster 
- Restore key services to functional level within 4.0 business hours of the disaster 
- Recover to Business as Usual within 8.0 to 24 hours of the disaster 
- Report to the ERT team leader 

# Disaster Recovery Plan Exercise: 
Disaster recovery plan exercises are an essential part of the plan development process. In a DRP exercise no one passes or fails; everyone who participates learns from the exercise â€“ what needs to be improved, and how the improvements can be implemented. 

Plan exercising ensures that emergency teams are familiar with their assignments and, more importantly, are confident in their capabilities. 

# Logging and documentation 
In the aftermath of the disaster the management team and the team members should get together to review the incident and the steps taken during the recovery phase in order to update and improve the Disaster Recovery Plan.
