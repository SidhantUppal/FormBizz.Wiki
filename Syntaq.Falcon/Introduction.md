The core SYNTAQ Falcon application comprises several components:

1. aspnetzero. a boiler plate framework which provides out the box support for our multi-tenanted application,
2. form.io for JSON form schema,
3. aspose.com for document assembly
4. Microsoft VSTS, word Add-In

If you would like to install everything locally and you aren't familiar with how to set up your development environment for these, you can click on the Developer Workstation link to show you everything you need know to know.

Otherwise, you can head over here, grab a copy of the source code and get started!
