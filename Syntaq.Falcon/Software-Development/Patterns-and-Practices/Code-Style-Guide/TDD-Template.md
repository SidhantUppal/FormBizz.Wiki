## Introduction
### Background
Describe any historical context that would be needed to understand the document, including legacy considerations.

### Work Package
- 

### Terminology
If the document uses any special words or terms, list them here.

### Non-Goals
If there are related problems that you have decided not to address with this design, but which someone might conceivably expect you to solve, then list them here.

## Proposed Design
## System Architecture
If the design consists of a collaboration between multiple large-scale components, list those components here â€” or better, include a diagram.

## Business Logic
If the design requires any non-trivial algorithms or logic, describe them.

## Sequence Diagram
Create a sequence diagram describing the dataflow based on the requirements, showing the interactions between the user and the system. 

## UI Components
These could be a wireframe or image of the required designs. 

## Interface/API Definitions
Describe how the various components talk to each other. For example, if there are REST endpoints, describe the endpoint URL and the format of the data and parameters used.

## Impact
Describe the potential impacts of the design on overall performance, security, and other aspects of the system.

## Risks
If there are any risks or unknowns, list them here. Also if there is additional research to be done, mention that as well.

## Alternatives
If there are other potential solutions which were considered and rejected, list them here, as well as the reason why they were not chosen.

## Migration Strategy
If the design incurs non-backwards-compatible changes to an existing system, describe the process whereby entities that depend on the system are going to migrate to the new design.
