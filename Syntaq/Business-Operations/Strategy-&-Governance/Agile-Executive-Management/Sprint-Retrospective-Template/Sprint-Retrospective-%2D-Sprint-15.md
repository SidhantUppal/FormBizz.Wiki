###1. Review Customer/Partner/Shareholders Value/Successes for the sprint

- Showcase the api and assembled documents with Hall & Wilcox, which lead to the introduction to Tony @ feynbrook
- Real positive feedback from H&W
- Connected with some industry bodies which might open up 
- We have access to the law society and we will be able to run an events
- Rolled out first release of syntaq.zendesk.com 
- David learning at 90deg


###2. Review the less than successes

- We haven't established any metrics across any business areas
- We haven't moved the capability ownership
- We haven't run any Operational review meetings
- Charged for azure services not being utilised....direct result of not having Business Operations meetings in respect of IT
- Our MSA is not up to scratch
- Provisioning of the sprint

###3. Review the Ah-ha's (light bulb moments)

- I had a session with Kirk where he showed me the level of automation they are getting to, and its insane. They are at a point where they can track the amount of time left after a sprint has been set up which allows them to adjust the amount of PD time they have and then based on time determine which lynda.com course might be relevant to them. which drives the fact that we can automate almost everything....not just software!
- We can get free access to lynda.com via south Australian library, need to see if this service is accessible in NZ
- We still don't have a scalable Business model but we have two options based on the market - SimmonsStewarts of the world (EA) or Adelta (solve a specific problem i.e. Wills and Estate pack)
- NetDocuments
- Can lean on support forums

###4. Any Appreciations for the week

- Agile/ lean is tough!!!
- Although the research we have done is great, we need to get down into the details - Jobs to do, pains and gains!!!
- The scale of the migration to SYNTAQ falcon

###5. Did we live our values?

###6. Review the impediments for the week

- Contract for H&W
- .netzero waiting for a response

### 7. What should we try next time?

- Need to standardise the tasks associated with each capability, currently cant track at a task level only at a User Story Level

###8. Add any actions into the strategy board ideas list

- Need to add monitoring for our 3rd party resources (zabbix)
- Standardise the details that are required at each level of a project; Epic -> Feature -> User Story -> Task
- Establish a capacity planning meeting & template which collects all the Activities | Outputs | Outcomes | Owner | Priority | Time Estimate before we provision the sprint allowing us to see how much time is spent on various tasks
