#Value Delivery
##Provisioning (BL)
* Some additional accounts have been provisioned on SYNTAQ:
* No new accounts were provisioned during the prior sprint
* Received an email from Andrew Simmonds, possibility he will want an account provisioned prior to his meeting with Bruce.
* We discussed the migration process with Travis/ Gerry whereby we would create a new account for each of their clients. Once their accounts were established they would start the account administration/ set-up and SYNTAQ would work on finalising the implementation for embedding ZumeForms forms into SYNTAQ portal. They estimate that Gerry will be OOO by March. 
* LSSA confirmed they have access to their account, they are waiting to start the testing process. 
* Bruce released a new API to the ZF platform allowing LC access to reports. 

##Service Delivery (DH)
* Need to get an email out to all clients about where they can submit their queries so that we can reduce the traffic coming into inbox further (for consideration when we migrate SYNTAQ). 
* Need to look into the integration of ZenDesk and DevOps. This remains an open issue for us to address. 
* Need to verify why we keep getting a bill on Zendesk for chat usage despite the fact we don't offer live chat. 

##Client Support (JD)
* Client support items remain light touch at the moment, which is helpful as we try and close down the final items for our Platform Demo. 
* Client Support process review (Open)
* Project Management Process review (Open)
* Open projects 
** Law Society: forms have been built into the new SYNTAQ application and the document templates have been mapped to the forms. Current Impediments: Rules builder/ script editor and the form properties (how checkboxes save data). 
** Hall&Wilcox: Document template is being tested, however there is an issue with the email workflow which is preventing proper testing. 
**DMAW: Still waiting on a response from them to close out the build. Currently we have 3 open issues with them; 1. file upload button (deployed), 2. Print form button (script has been developed) and 3. Custom CSS for radio (probably wont be required if we can address point 2).
** Settify: Bruce needs to respond to Athol about authentication. 

##De-Provisioning (BF)
* Currently not an issue, one of the big things that came out of closing down the zumedocs account was the ability to export client data. This needs, to be discussed so that we can cater to clients who wish to export their forms, apps or data after they decide to cancel their subscriptions. 

##Value Delivery Metrics
###Time Tracking
* We need to make sure we put some extra effort in, in tracking the different types of tasks we are doing. Sprint 27 didnt have any time tracked against any of the dev/ops team. 
* NEED TO ADD THE TIME BETWEEN TICKET RAISED AND TICKET CLOSED....
* Need to look at average response time for a ticket
* Need to look at help centre content most view

###Open Tickets
* We have 29 open tickets on the IT board, down 3 from the last sprint
* 8 open tickets are assigned to the current sprint
