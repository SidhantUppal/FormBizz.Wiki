#Value Delivery
##Provisioning (BL)
* Some additional accounts have been provisioned on SYNTAQ:
** Constantine Legal
** Chapman Tripp
** Automation Station
* Bjarke now provisioning the sub-domains, using the process set out in realtimeboard, seems to have resolved the issues in the short term while we provision accounts manually. This will need to be looked into once we roll out a true SaaS product. 
* Page Create are starting to ask about the migration process. Need to start thinking about the practicalities of the migration, we have a small pool of customers, we should be able to work through each one individually. 

##Service Delivery (DH)
* Need to get an email out to all clients about where they can submit their queries so that we can reduce the traffic coming into inbox further. 
* Microsoft scheduling has been rolled out and is operational
* Need to look into the integration of ZenDesk and DevOps.

##Client Support (JD)
* Client support was light throughout the holiday period
* Client Support process review
* Project Management Process review
* Open projects 
** Law Society: forms have been built into the new SYNTAQ application, we have received 
** LC: Form report
** Hall&Wilcox: Josh has coded up the first round template, waiting on final response from H&W before testing
**DMAW: Still waiting on a response from them to close out the build. Currently we have 3 open issues with them; 1. file upload button (needs to be rolled out), 2. Print form button and 3. Custom CSS for radio.
** Settify: We sent Athol a first draft of the EPOA Victoria, waiting on integration feedback. proposing we get access to their preferred client to see if this is something they would be interested in "funding"

##De-Provisioning (BF)
* Currently not an issue, one of the big things that came out of closing down the zumedocs account was the ability to export client data. This needs, to be discussed so that we can cater to clients who wish to export their forms, apps or data after they decide to cancel their subscriptions. 

##Value Delivery Metrics
###Time Tracking
* We need to make sure we put some extra effort in, in tracking the different types of tasks we are doing
* ensure we only use the templates that have been provided, if we are missing something then, please post it on Teams and we can get it added
* NEED TO ADD THE TIME BETWEEN TICKET RAISED AND TICKET CLOSED....
* Need to look at average response time for a ticket
* Need to look at help centre content most view

###Open Tickets
* We have 32 open tickets on the IT board, 1 more than last sprint
* 9 open tickets are assigned to the current sprint
* Page Create current has the most open tickets and creates the most submissions
