#Value Delivery
##Provisioning (BL)
* We have provisioned a number of new accounts on SYNTAQ, in addition we ran demo sessions to show users the new client portal
* As part of the demo sessions some key points were discussed around MS Flow and Zapier. We need to help users with this, explaining what information is available through the platform and how it can be used in an assembly process.

*Need to figure out how we manage the provisioning pipeline. TBC

##Service Delivery (DH)
* Still getting a couple emails direct from clients, rather than going through Zen, notably Constantine Legal. Also need to look at our other client 

##Client Support (JD)
* Client support has been relatively light over the last 2 sprints, with limited issues reported.
* A significant amount of work has gone into the development of forms and templates for two customers DMAW and Tax Assure. We need to agree the delivery and handover process as we got stung by the implementation especially when a client doesn't know exactly what they want.
* Client Support process review
* Project Management Process review
* Open projects 
** Law Society: forms are being built into the new SYNTAQ application
** Hall&Wilcox: Discretionary Trust has been provided for assessment

##De-Provisioning (BF)
* As part of the migration process we will need to consider how we de-provision the old zumeforms accounts.
