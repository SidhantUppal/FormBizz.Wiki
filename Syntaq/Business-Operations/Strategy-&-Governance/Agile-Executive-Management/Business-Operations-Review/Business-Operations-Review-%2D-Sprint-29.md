#Value Delivery
##Provisioning (BL)
* Some additional accounts have been provisioned on SYNTAQ:
** Automation Station
** Enernet
** EasyLaw
** Created Portal.syntaq.com (didnt receive the welcome email to activate the account, sent to admin@syntaq.com)
* Agreed terms provisional terms with Gerry, Enterprise account with 
* Need to follow up Andrews meeting with Bruce, ill provision an account for him prior to this meeting. Need to confirm date. 
* We discussed the migration process with Travis/ Gerry whereby we would create a new account for each of their clients. Once their accounts were established they would start the account administration/ set-up and SYNTAQ would work on finalising the implementation for embedding ZumeForms forms into SYNTAQ portal. They estimate that Gerry will be OOO by March. 

##Service Delivery (DH)
* Need to get an email out to all clients about where they can submit their queries so that we can reduce the traffic coming into inbox further (for consideration when we migrate SYNTAQ). 
* Need to look into the integration of ZenDesk and DevOps. This remains an open issue for us to address.....Still open issue. Although not great is limited impact on the team. 
*

##Client Support (JD)
* Terrible week on ZUmeFroms last week with client support request. Not sure what is being changed that is causing all the issues. 
* Client Support process review (Open)
* Project Management Process review (Open)
* Open projects 
** Law Society:  
** Josh deployed first draft of the forms and templates to LSSA last week. will start testing. Critical items for consideration
** Checkbox Group
** Radios Group
** SSO
** Embed
** Integration with iMIS

** Hall&Wilcox: documnet template has been tested, we are waiting on final feedback from H&W. Also followed up on Estate planning documents  
**DMAW: Couple minor issues with DMAW. 1. after logging into their portal the forms dont load on first login. you need to refresh the page before the form loads. There seems to be an issue with submission workflow and they too are being affected by the email summary issue. 
**Pegasus Legal: SSO integration and embed requirements for their portal
** Settify: Question about whether we should pursue this???

##De-Provisioning (BF)
* Currently not an issue, one of the big things that came out of closing down the zumedocs account was the ability to export client data. This needs, to be discussed so that we can cater to clients who wish to export their forms, apps or data after they decide to cancel their subscriptions. 

##Value Delivery Metrics
###Time Tracking
* We need to make sure we put some extra effort in, in tracking the different types of tasks we are doing. Soo effort in terms of tracking of time, however tracking time tracking in a single card doesn't help evaluate the time/ effort take on various tasks. 
* NEED TO ADD THE TIME BETWEEN TICKET RAISED AND TICKET CLOSED.... This will be resolved in the rebuild of the sprint metrics board which is jnow integrated with PowerBI. I'll be working on the new metrics boards. 

###Open Tickets
* We have 48 open tickets on the IT board, significantly up on the prior sprint period. 
* 13 open tickets are assigned to the current sprint
